Brief Report of Iteration 1:

During this Iteration G-18 worked on multiple aspects of the our computer science calculator app. Mark Groves worked on the Combinations and Permutations User Story, Jesus Ayala worked on the Matrix Operations User Story, Quinci Cuthbert worked on the Truth Tables User Story, Sean Stitzer worked on the Java Data Type Calculator user story, and Cole Delinski worked on the Conversion User Stories. While the rest  of the team worked to complete significant parts of their user stories, Cole finished the Conversions User Stories for this iterations completed user stories as they were the simplest to implement and write tests for so they were enough for one to do alone while work was being done on the other parts. At the end of the first iteration the home calculator has a functional UI that is able to convert between Binary, Decimal, and, Hexadecimal in all ways using the = button. The +, -, *, and / buttons on the home calculator were partially coded however they are not functional in the way intended yet which is no issue as they were not meant to be part of the first iteration as they are part of the calculations user stories. The difficulties our group came across in the first iteration were that it was difficult for us to find times in which all of us were able to meet up together and talk about the project for a substantial amount of time and that it was difficult to properly configure our project for the Espresso tests as it was missing auto-generated test folders.
